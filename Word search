creat a new string object getting the user input from the keyboard using the imported scanner,
this will be the next word we will be looking for.
Use dot notation toLowerCase() and charAt() to grab the first letter of the entered word by the user at index 0.
Then the program will look at the text file and find the matching character to the first letter of the 
entered word in a do-while loop,since we want it too at least run once, then using a simple if-else statement ,
if those characters match(==)then we will compare the next letters of the word, else move on to the next char
in the text file.

If after the do-while loop's execution there was no matching word, system.out.println("word not found!");
else rewrite the scanner object to ask for the next word from the user.
In the entire program, if the string entered by the user .equals(quit), the user will be asked if they want to end 
their session(y/n)? then:
boolean playAgain = false;
if(char input = 'y' ){  playAgain = true; }
else { playAgain}

the outer do-while loop will only run if the boolean playAgain is false; so do{...} while (playAgain)
