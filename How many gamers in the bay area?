First of all, the word “Gamer” needs to be specifically defined.
Considering the most common definition of that word, people who play video games, it has definitely gotten more
difficult to grab these stats now comparing to the past few years.
We will need to think about the number of stores selling video games in the bay area and number of video games
sold annually. Also the online transactions that happen with the zip codes associated with the bay area.
This will only be a small portion of the population.
Mobile gaming is a great portion of the number of gamers, especially in a city like San Francisco,
where everyone is on the go and mostly on a public transaction, most people are on their phone and handheld
gaming devices, playing one of the billion games available on the online app stores and markets.
So we will need to look into the number of people games sold on the online stores such as apple’s app store or 
androids market and google play.
Consumers and demand are only increasing, so we either will need to keep the estimated result as
an often updated data, or choose a time interval and grab the data from all the participating markets.
